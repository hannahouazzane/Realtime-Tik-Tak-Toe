# Real-time Tiktaktoe

A real-time tiktaktoe game that allows users to enter a room of their choosing, and play with others across the globe.
This project utilises Reactjs with Socket.io to establish real-time communication. 

On page load, users see the game lobby where they can enter their name and desired room
